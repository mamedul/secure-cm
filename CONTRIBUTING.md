## How Can I Contribute?

*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mamedul/secure-cm/issues/new "null"). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
    
3.  Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).

*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
